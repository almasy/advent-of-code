# Advent of Code

Its creator [defines Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about)
as an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I've started my [AoC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) project few months 
too late, hence any sort of "daily challenge" or competition was immediately
out of question. Therefore, I found myself a different path - the daily puzzles
will serve as an excuse to develop a "pico-framework" for the 
"Unified AoC solution management".

For now, I'm focusing on the JVM platform, namely [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Java](https://openjdk.org/). [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) will have to wait in the pipeline this time...

Please check the [advent-of-code-kotlin](./advent-of-code-kotlin/) and [advent-of-code-java](./advent-of-code-java/)
README files for specific requirements and user / developer instructions.
